📘 Mini Math Utilities
A handy set of basic mathematical programs implemented in C/C++ — great for students, beginners, and those who love clean logic!

✨ What's Inside?
This mini repo includes core math utilities written in C/C++ — nothing too fancy, just powerful simplicity. Ideal for brushing up on fundamental logic and matrix handling.

Program	Description
🔢 MatrixMultiplication.c	Multiplies two 3x3 matrices and prints the result
🧮 SquareOfMatrix.c	        Computes the square of a 3x3 matrix (i.e., A × A)
🔁 PowerUsingRecursion.c	Calculates power (a^b) using recursion

🛠 How to Run
Make sure you have a C compiler installed (like GCC). Then compile and run like so:

gcc MatrixMultiplication.c -o matrix
./matrix

Do the same for the others.
